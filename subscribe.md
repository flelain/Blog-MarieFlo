<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This is a personal website, tailored to share our family adventures in Canada as well as professional-oriented projects. The site creation and maintenance overtime is in itself one of these projects, involving the five of us, especially in the content production!</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sergiokopplin/">Sergio Kopplin</a> and its minimalist <a href="https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo">Indigo Template</a> with which I quickly set up this website and learnt a lot in the same time!
